# Book App

Book App is basically simple app that help us to manage our book properly and systematically.

## Problem

As a reader, we all have the same concern about managing our current book, or the upcoming book. For instance, we often forget with all of the books that we've read and get confused to handle our desire to buy a new book. Book App solves that common problem.

### App Demo

I already provided the tutorial for how the user utilizes this app. Hopefully, it can make the user understand enough about the workflow and the way they operate the app. Besides the video tutorial, I also classify and explain the definition of each page clearly.
